# ECS app utils

Utilities for deploying Django app (nginx/app, rabbitmq, celery worker) with AWS ECS Fargate.

## Contents

### Terraform modules
* `terraform/`
    * `network/` - load balancer, target group, routing, other network resources
    * `services/`
        * `load_balanced` - ECS service connected to load balancer target group (e.g. nginx/web)
        * `discoverable` - ECS service with service discovery (e.g. RabbitMQ)
        * `generic` - ECS service with no load balancer or service discovery (e.g. Celery worker)

## Getting started

### AWS requirements
The Terraform config assumes a couple of AWS resources are manually created prior to setting up the rest of the resources (these can be set up via the console).
* ECS cluster (`cluster_name` is the name of the ECS cluster)
* SSL certificate (`ssl_certificate_arm` is the ARN of the certificate)
